Titanic Data Analysis using Python

This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the Titanic dataset. The aim of the project is to understand key patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data using powerful visualization and statistical tools.

Objective

- Understand data using statistics and visualizations.
- Identify survival factors among Titanic passengers.
- Practice data preprocessing, summary statistics, and visual storytelling.

Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas – data manipulation  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – static visualizations  
- Plotly – interactive charts

Key Tasks Performed

1. Imported and explored the Titanic dataset
   - Displayed first few rows and dataset structure
   - Checked for missing values
   - Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)

2. Visualized numeric features
   - Created histograms and boxplots for each numeric column using both Seaborn and Plotly

3. Explored feature relationships
   - Created pairplots and correlation heatmaps to understand interactions between numeric features

4. Identified patterns and trends
   - Analyzed survival rate by sex, class, age, fare, family size, and embarkation point

5. Made basic feature-level inferences
   - Females and children had higher survival rates
   - 1st class passengers had better chances than 3rd class
   - Passengers with 1–2 family members had better survival rates than those alone or in large families
   - Fare had significant outliers; very high-paying passengers were mostly in 1st class
   - Substantial missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

Notable Insights

- Gender & Age: Women and young children (<10 years) had a higher chance of survival.
- Pclass: 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate.
- Fare: Higher fares correlated with survival, especially for 1st class passengers.
- Family Size: Moderate family groups (1–2 members) had better survival odds.
- Missing Data: Most missing values occurred in Cabin, Age, and Embarked, especially among 3rd class passengers.
